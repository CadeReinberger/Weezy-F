# Weezy F
 And the F is for "Phenomenal". An audio-based Quiz Bowl Reader in Python. 
 
 ## About
 
 The project is relatively simple in it's purpose--allowing one to walk around with a laptop and headphones listening to quiz bowl questions at will. The implementation consists of 
 
 * Quizdb - A quiz-bowl database with a publilcly available Postgres dump
 * Psycopg2 to get questions from the database in python
 * Using Pandas bultin Excel Handling to read special questions from Excel one gets from analyzing frequency lists
 * A combination of gTTS and Pyttsx3 for both online and offline text-to-speech handling
 * An object-oriented approach to Question objects, including builtin data-cleaning for clear speech processing
 
 The name comes from my favorite Quiz bowl question, the answer to which is American rapper "Little Wayne", and the question also notes that Lil Wayne says his "picture should be in the dictionary next to the definition of defninition, because repition is the father of learning". It is indeed. Happy quizzing. 
 
 If you have any quesitons about getting this up and implemented, feel free to contact me!
